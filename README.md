# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Support-Vector-Machine
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on a set of features derived from digitized images of fine-needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass tissue. The dataset used is the famous Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
